# Patient Readmission Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hospital patient data to predict the risk of readmission using machine learning and data analytics. The goal is to help healthcare providers identify high-risk patients and take preventive actions to reduce readmissions.

---

## Problem Statement
Hospital readmissions increase healthcare costs and often indicate gaps in post-discharge care. Predicting patient readmission risk enables hospitals to improve patient outcomes and optimize resource utilization.

---

## Solution Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Logistic Regression model for readmission prediction
- Handling class imbalance using class-weighted modeling
- Risk stratification into Low, Medium, and High categories
- Interactive Tableau dashboard for insight visualization

---

## 🛠Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Tableau**
- **Healthcare Analytics**

---

## Key Insights
- Readmission risk increases with patient age
- Longer hospital stays are associated with higher readmission risk
- Most patients fall into the medium-risk category
- High-risk patients represent a smaller but critical group
